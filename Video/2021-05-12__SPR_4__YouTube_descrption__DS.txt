The Missing Pieces of Quantum Mechanics

The fourth video in the Spiritual Physics Research Discussion Series talking
about the missing pieces needed to understand quantum mechanics. Rev. Lara Hoke
kindly provided a spiritual frame for the evening. Doug Sweetser presented for
a general audience the core ideas behind relativity in physics. After
presenting enough slides to explain this newly designed t-shirt in about a
50 minutes, the zoom room was opened up for discussion and open-ended questions
(not included). 

The Simple Math Rule remains in effect for all slides, with no math
expressions more complicated than a square (one number times itself).
