# t-shirts!

If an idea is compact and elegant, it should work on a t-shirt.



These are not a good deal, but research like this that has taken
decades is expensive. With the fees and all, the t-shirts cost
some $30, while the hoodie clocks in at $50. Ouch. Still, nothing
like these anywhere else on the planet. Consider it :-)

Each design comes in a variety of colors and the usual range of sizes.
