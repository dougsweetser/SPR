## Thich Nhat Hanh - The Present

This was the reading from the Rev. Lara Hoke December 6, 2020 sermon at First Church
Unitarian (FCU) Littleton that motivated Doug Sweetser to start the Spiritual Physics
Research Discussion Series...

    “To return to the present is to be in contact with life. Life can be found
    only in the present moment, because ‘the past no longer is’ and ‘the future has
    not yet come.’  Buddhahood, liberation, awakening, peace, joy, and happiness
    can only be found in the present moment. Our appointment with life is in the
    present moment. The place of our appointment is right here, in this very
    place…. To abandon the present moment in order to look for these things in the
    future is to throw away the substance and hold onto the shadow…. To be able to
    stop pursuing the future allows us to realize all the wonderful things we seek
    are present in us, in the present moment. Life is not a particular place or a
    destination. Life is a path…. Every step can bring us peace, joy, and
    liberation…. Our appointment with the Buddha, with liberation, and with
    happiness is here and now. We should not miss this appointment.”

## The 5 Most Important Equations in All of Physics

The first in the series! The slide presentation lasted 47 minutes. We followed
the Niela Miller Simple Math Rule (SMR), nothing more complicated that multiplying
a number by itself was used.
