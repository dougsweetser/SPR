## Thich Nhat Hanh - The Present

This was the reading from the Rev. Lara Hoke December 6, 2020 sermon at First Church
Unitarian (FCU) Littleton that motivated Doug Sweetser to start the Spiritual Physics
Research Discussion Series...

    “To return to the present is to be in contact with life. Life can be found
    only in the present moment, because ‘the past no longer is’ and ‘the future has
    not yet come.’  Buddhahood, liberation, awakening, peace, joy, and happiness
    can only be found in the present moment. Our appointment with life is in the
    present moment. The place of our appointment is right here, in this very
    place…. To abandon the present moment in order to look for these things in the
    future is to throw away the substance and hold onto the shadow…. To be able to
    stop pursuing the future allows us to realize all the wonderful things we seek
    are present in us, in the present moment. Life is not a particular place or a
    destination. Life is a path…. Every step can bring us peace, joy, and
    liberation…. Our appointment with the Buddha, with liberation, and with
    happiness is here and now. We should not miss this appointment.” 

From: _Our Appointment With Life: Sutra on Knowing the Better Way to Live Alone_

## The 5 Most Important Equations in All of Physics

The first in the series! The slide presentation lasted 47 minutes. We followed
the Niela Miller Simple Math Rule (SMR), nothing more complicated that multiplying
a number by itself was used.

## For relativity, we all see things differently and 
## we all can agree to parts of squares

The second discussion had the same size crowd, so not too many were scared away. The 
slide presentation lasted 53 minutes.

## For gravity, we all see things differently and 
## we all can agree to parts of squares

Notice how similar the title is! That is the most amazing thing about the proposal. There is a new idea about inertia: it is all about many, many spinning tops. There are so many spinning tops, the arrows used to describe tops cancel. What remains is the energy part of returning-momentum-erergy. It is this energy that is inertia.

## The Missing Pieces of Quantum Mechanics

We know there are many diverse approaches to the idea of God. There are also many ideas about how to approach quantum mechanics. While I am at peace with religeous diversity, I do not feel that way about interpretations of quantum mechanics. In my opinion, there are 2 pieces missing. The first is that one must do the work of transitioning from complex numbers which are useful but not physically meaningful to space-time numbers that can be mapped directly to events in space-time. The second is that the events that quantum mechanics work with are space-like separated from the observer.
