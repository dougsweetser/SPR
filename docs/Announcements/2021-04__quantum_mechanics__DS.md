# Announcing the fourth Spiritual Physics Research Discussion Series in next Friday, Apr. 30 at, 7:00 PM

The discussion is titled: "Missing pieces from quantum mechanics".

Rev. Lara Hoke will kindly provide a spiritual frame for the evening. Doug
Sweetser will present slides for a general audience for about a half-hour,
followed by an open discussion. A $5 donation for First Church Unitarian can be
made the usual way if you have the means.
