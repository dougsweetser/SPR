# Announcing the second Spiritual Physics Research Discussion Series in 2 weeks Friday, Feb. 26, 7:00 PM

Zoom with us again in two weeks, the last Friday of the month Friday, Jan. 26,
from 7:00 - 8:30 PM 

The second discussionn is titled: "For relativity, we all see things differently and
we all can agree to parts of squares."

Rev. Lara Hoke will kindly provide a spiritual frame for the evening. Doug
Sweetser will present for a general audience the core ideas behind 
relativity in physics. After presenting enough slides to explain this newly
designed t-shirt in about a half-hour, the zoom room will be opened up for
discussion and open-ended questions.

The Niela Miller Simple Math Rule remains in effect for all slides, with no math
expressions more complicated than a square (one number times itself).

A $5 donation for First Church Unitarian can be made here:

memo line to FCU; 19 Foster St., Littleton, MA 01460. No donation is necessary
