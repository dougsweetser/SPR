# Announcing the Spiritual Physics Research Discussion Series this Friday, Jan. 29

Zoom with us the last Friday of the next five months from 7:00 - 8:30 PM,
starting this Friday, Jan. 29. Rev. Lara Hoke will provide a spiritual frame
for the topic each evening. Doug Sweetser will present for a general audience
an issue in physics with our current approach and detail its limitations. Doug
does unfunded research in the numbers that Nature may be using for their magic.
Doug's divergent approach will be encapsulated in a t-shirt for each talk.
After presenting enough slides to explain the t-shirt in under a half-hour, the
zoom room will be opened up for discussion and open-ended questions.

The first talk is titled: "The three most important equations in all of
mathematical physics: 0+0=0, 0x0=0, and 1x1=1 - Always here-now and seen." The
next topics will be relativity, gravity, quantum mechanics, and visualization.
The Niela Miller Simple Math Rule will be enforced for all slides, with no math
expressions more complicated than a square (one number times itself).

A $5 donation for First Church Unitarian can be made here:

memo line to FCU; 19 Foster St., Littleton, MA 01460. No donation is necessary
