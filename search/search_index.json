Thich Nhat Hanh - The Present This was the reading from the Rev. Lara Hoke December 6, 2020 sermon at First Church Unitarian (FCU) Littleton that motivated Doug Sweetser to start the Spiritual Physics Research Discussion Series... \u201cTo return to the present is to be in contact with life. Life can be found only in the present moment, because \u2018the past no longer is\u2019 and \u2018the future has not yet come.\u2019 Buddhahood, liberation, awakening, peace, joy, and happiness can only be found in the present moment. Our appointment with life is in the present moment. The place of our appointment is right here, in this very place\u2026. To abandon the present moment in order to look for these things in the future is to throw away the substance and hold onto the shadow\u2026. To be able to stop pursuing the future allows us to realize all the wonderful things we seek are present in us, in the present moment. Life is not a particular place or a destination. Life is a path\u2026. Every step can bring us peace, joy, and liberation\u2026. Our appointment with the Buddha, with liberation, and with happiness is here and now. We should not miss this appointment.\u201d From: Our Appointment With Life: Sutra on Knowing the Better Way to Live Alone by Thich Nhat Hanh, Parallax Press, Berkeley, CA, 2011, pp. 47-48) The 5 Most Important Equations in All of Physics The first in the series! The slide presentation lasted 47 minutes. We followed the Niela Miller Simple Math Rule (SMR), nothing more complicated that multiplying a number by itself was used.","title":"Videos"},{"location":"Videos/videos/#videos","text":"All will be available on YouTube, but can be run from here.","title":"Videos"},{"location":"Videos/videos/#thich-nhat-hanh-the-present","text":"This was the reading from the Rev.
