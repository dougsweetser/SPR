Rev. Lara Hoke will provide a spiritual frame for the topic each evening. Doug Sweetser will present for a general audience an issue in physics with our current approach and detail its limitations. Doug does unfunded research in the numbers that Nature may be using for their magic. Doug's divergent approach will be encapsulated in a t-shirt for each talk. After presenting enough slides to explain the t-shirt in under a half-hour, the zoom room will be opened up for discussion and open-ended questions. The first talk is titled: \"The three most important equations in all of mathematical physics: 0+0=0, 0x0=0, and 1x1=1 - Always here-now and seen.\" The next topics will be relativity, gravity, quantum mechanics, and visualization. The Niela Miller Simple Math Rule will be enforced for all slides, with no math expressions more complicated than a square (one number times itself). A $5 donation for First Church Unitarian can be made here: https://www.fculittle.org/donate-now/, or send a check with \"physics\" in the memo line to FCU; 19 Foster St., Littleton, MA 01460.

Thich Nhat Hanh - The Present This was the reading from the Rev. Lara Hoke December 6, 2020 sermon at First Church Unitarian (FCU) Littleton that motivated Doug Sweetser to start the Spiritual Physics Research Discussion Series... \u201cTo return to the present is to be in contact with life. Life can be found only in the present moment, because \u2018the past no longer is\u2019 and \u2018the future has not yet come.\u2019 Buddhahood, liberation, awakening, peace, joy, and happiness can only be found in the present moment. Our appointment with life is in the present moment. The place of our appointment is right here, in this very place\u2026. To abandon the present moment in order to look for these things in the future is to throw away the substance and hold onto the shadow\u2026. To be able to stop pursuing the future allows us to realize all the wonderful things we seek are present in us, in the present moment. Life is not a particular place or a destination. Life is a path\u2026. Every step can bring us peace, joy, and liberation\u2026. Our appointment with the Buddha, with liberation, and with happiness is here and now.
